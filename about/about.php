<i>We are located in the former Blue Hills Mansion.</i>     
    <p>The Pitt County Cultural Center (PCCC) is dedicated to facilitating diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Greenville area.</p>
<p>PCCC became an IRS-recognized nonprofit on August 22, 1987, officially opening its doors with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Center was closed for remodeling in 2000 and 2001, reopening to the public in April 2002.</p>
<p>PCCC is housed in a historic building that began its life in 1935, and houses a theatre, gallery, meeting spaces, and an outside terrace. A kitchen and culinary arts studio are planned as part of future renovations.</p>
